=head1 Serengeti - High-level automation tool for scraping websites.

Serengeti is a framework that lets you scrape websites using JavaScript 
syntax. It can use various backends such as Selenium or the built-in native 
client to do its job.

The tool provides developers with both high-level (think DOM, forms etc) as 
well as more low-level access (think raw source) of the resources it requests.
